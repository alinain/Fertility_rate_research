**Introduction**

Population growth and its impact on the environment are critical considerations for sustainable development. Understanding the evolution of fertility rates plays a vital role in comprehending the environmental consequences of population growth and enables the formulation of strategies and policies that support sustainable population growth while maintaining a harmonious relationship between human well-being and the natural environment. 

  
To gain deeper insights into fertility rate trends, this project focuses on analyzing fertility data from 20 different countries across various continents. While not providing a comprehensive overview of global fertility patterns, these countries represent a diverse range of social, economic, and political conditions. In addition to collecting fertility data, this project also examines other factors that potentially influence fertility, including education index, rule of law index, and the percentage of religious population. Analyzing these factors will help to understand how education, legal frameworks, and religious beliefs influence fertility decisions, aiding in the development of targeted policies and interventions.  


This project aimes to provide valuable insights into the drivers of fertility rates and examine the correlations between fertility rates and factors such as education, rule of law, and religiosity. By analyzing and understanding these relationships, policymakers and stakeholders can make informed decisions to promote sustainable population growth, design effective interventions, and develop policies that support the well-being of individuals and the environment.

**Where do we have the data from?**

The data regarding fertility rate and rule of law index have been downloaded from TheGlobalEconomy.com 
where over 300 carefully selected indicators are presented from multiple official sources such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations, and the World Economic Forum.

Education index data where downloaded from **https://data.humdata.org/**, a platform developed and maintained by the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) initiative. The platform focuses on collecting, sharing, and analyzing humanitarian data to support decision-making and improve humanitarian responses.
